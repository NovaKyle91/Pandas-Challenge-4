Hello,

Thank you for taking the time to review my Challenge 4 - Pandas from Module 4.

In the starter code file you will find a folder labeled PyCitySchools. Within that folder you will find my ipynb file for you to review my work, findings, and analysis for Challenge 4 - Pandas. The ipynb file is labeled PyCitySchoolsKNovak.ipynb.

There is also a CSV file labeled city_school_final.xlsv
