# Pandas-Challenge-4
Kyle Novak's Module 4 Challenge 4

Hello,

Thank you for taking the time to review my Challenge 4 - Pandas from Module 4.

In the starter code file you will find a folder labeled PyCitySchools. Within that folder you will find my ipynb file for you to review my work, findings, and analysis for Challenge 4 - Pandas. The ipynb file is labeled PyCitySchoolsKNovak.ipynb.

The folder PyCitySchools also has a folder of resources where you will find the excel files of the data pulled for this assignment as well as a merged .csv file (city school data complete) of the 2 initial excel files.

There is also an excel file labeled city_school_final.xlsv that can be found in the PyCitySchools folder.

I used markdowns to help organize the structure of the assignment and notes of my coding process.

My analysis will be found as a markdown at the very top of the ipynb file.

Please reach out should you have any questions.

Cheers,
- Kyle Novak
